# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction 📈💰

## 🚀 Project Overview
Predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using real business data to help optimize marketing spends and customer targeting.  
Built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn, the model segments customers based on future value.  
Visualized key insights and model performance using Seaborn and Matplotlib.  
This project helps businesses identify high-value customers early and increase profitability.

## 🧠 Learnings & Future Scope
This project helped me strengthen data preprocessing, regression modeling, and business interpretation.  
Future scope includes time-based CLV (using BG/NBD), marketing mix modeling, and dashboard integration using Streamlit.
